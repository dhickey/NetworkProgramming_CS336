Homework 1:
Write a java console program called launcher
Prompt the user 1-8 for:
    Taskmgr.exe
    notepad.exe
    charmap.exe
    snippingTool.exe
    msinfo32.exe
    winver.exe
    nslookup.exe
    cmd.exe
Take user input 1-8
Use java ProcessBuilder to start the processs
After a process has been created, output PID
Prompt user again until user enters 0

Exceptions:
nslookup.exe 
cmd.exe
Denote with * in menu
Launcher needs to share the console

the programs need to call ProcessBuilder.inheritIO() before launch 
Launcher must call Process.waitFor(), Process.exitValue(), Process.Info()
    Output:
    exit code
    CPU Time

If invalid input prompt user again
